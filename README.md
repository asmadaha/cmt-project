# The Fragility of Trust: Modeling Cooperation and Defection in a Noisy Networked Prisoner's Dilemma

## Project Description

This project develops a computational model to study the evolution of cooperation in a population of interacting agents when interactions are subject to stochstic noise. The system is modeled as a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma played on a fixed network, where agents follow simple behavioral strategies and may make mistakes in executing intended actions.

The objective is to quantify how increasing noise levels influence: 

* short-term cooperation dynamics,
* long-term cooperation levels,
* the stability and breakdown of cooperative behavior.

The model includes four classical strategies: 
* ALLC - Always Cooperate
* ALLD - Always Defect
* TFT - Tit-for-Tat
* GRUD - Grudger

At each interaction, agents may unintentionally flip their intended action with probability p_noise, reflecting real-world execution errors and misunderstandings. After each round, agents update their strategies by imitating neighbors with higher payoffs.

The project combines: 
* C for the agent-based simulation,
* MATLAB for post-processing, analysis and visualization.


### Input files

There are no external user-provided inputs. 

All CSV files are generated automatically by the C simulation and saved in the "data/" directory.

Each CSV file contains : 
* time step index,
* fraction of cooperative actions at each time step,
* final strategy composition (appended at the end of the file).

### Output files

All outputs are generated automatically in the "results/" directory.

Three PNG figures are produced in "results/figures/":
  * coop_time_multiple_noise.png : cooperation dynamics over time for all noise levels on a single plot
  * final_coop_vs_noise.png : final cooperation fraction as a function of noise probability
  * coop_heatmap_time_noise.png : heatmap showing cooperation dynamics across time and noise levels

These figures are used in the final report. 

### Report

The final report is located at "docs/report.pdf".

It follows the required structure:
1. Deviations from project proposal
2. Introduction
3. Approach
4. Results
5. Conclusion and outlook
6. Authorship statement

## Running the program

### Dependencies

* GCC
* MATLAB (available on the SIE Ubuntu Linux VDI)

The project was developed on macOS and fully tested on the SIE Ubuntu Linux VDI. 

### Build

The entire project, including compilation, simulation, data generation, and figure creation, can be reproduced from a single terminal command.

From the project root directory: bash run.sh

This automatically:
* Compiles the C simulation,
* Runs the simulation for all noise levels,
* Generates all CSV data files,
* Executes MATLAB in non-interactive mode,
* Produces all figures used in the report.

A fixed random seed is used to ensure exact reproducibility of results.

### Execute 

This command generates the figures used in the report, which are located in "results/figures/".
