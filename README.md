# The Fragility of Trust: Modeling Cooperation and Defection in a Noisy Networked Prisoner's Dilemma

## Project Description

This project develops a computational model to study the evolution of cooperation in a population of interacting agents when interactions are subject to stochstic noise. The system is modeled as a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma played on a fixed network, where agents follow simple behavioral strategies and may make mistakes in executing intended actions.

The objective is to quantify how increasing noise levels influence: 

* short-term cooperation dynamics,
* long-term cooperation levels,
* the stability and breakdown of cooperative behavior.

The model includes four classical strategies: 
* ALLC - Always Cooperate
* ALLD - Always Defect
* TFT - Tit-for-Tat
* GRUD - Grudger

At each interaction, agents may unintentionally flip their intended action with probability p_noise, reflecting real-world execution errors and misunderstandings. After each round, agents update their strategies by imitating neighbors with higher payoffs.

The project combines: 
* C for the agent-based simulation,
* MATLAB for post-processing, analysis and visualization.


### Input files

There are no external user-provided inputs. 

All CSV files are generated automatically by the C simulation and saved in the "data/" directory.

Each CSV file contains : 
* time step index,
* fraction of cooperative actions at each time step,
* final strategy composition (appended at the end of the file).

### Output files

All outputs are generated automatically in the "results/" directory.

Three PNG figures are produced in "results/figures/":
  * coop_time_multiple_noise.png : cooperation dynamics over time for all noise levels on a single plot
  * final_coop_vs_noise.png : final cooperation fraction as a function of noise probability
  * coop_heatmap_time_noise.png : heatmap showing cooperation dynamics across time and noise levels

These figures are used in the final report. 

### Report

The final report is located at "docs/report.pdf".

It follows the required structure:
1. Deviations from project proposal
2. Introduction
3. Approach
4. Results
5. Conclusion and outlook
6. Authorship statement

## Running the program

### Dependencies

The project was developed and testeed on macOS, but is designed to run on the SIE Ubuntu Linux VDI. 

### Build

To ensure reproducible results, the C simulation used a fixed random seed. 
Running the commands below will regenerate exactly the same CSV files and figures used in the final report. 

The project was developed on macOS and is fully compatible with the SIE Linux VDI. 

From the project root directory, compile the C simulation. 

gcc -O3 -std=c11 src/c/pd_simulation.c -o bin/pd_simulation

This creates the executable in "bin/".

### Execute 

From the project root still, run the C simulations:

./bin/pd_simulation 0.00 data/pnoise_0.00.csv
./bin/pd_simulation 0.01 data/pnoise_0.01.csv
./bin/pd_simulation 0.02 data/pnoise_0.02.csv
./bin/pd_simulation 0.05 data/pnoise_0.05.csv
./bin/pd_simulation 0.10 data/pnoise_0.10.csv

Then run MATLAB analysis:

addpath("src/matlab")
analyze_results

This command generates the figures used in the report, which are located in "results/figures/".
