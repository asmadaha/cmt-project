# The Fragility of Trust: Modeling Cooperation and Defection i a Noisy Networked Priosner's Dilemma

## Project Description

This project simulates the evolution of cooperation in a networked repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma with stochastic noise. One hundred agents interact repeatedly while following classical strategies:

* ALLC - Always Cooperate
* ALLD - Always Defect
* TFT - Tit-for-Tat
* GRUD - Grudger

At each interaction, agents may unintentionally flip their intended action with probability p_noise, reflecting real-world mistakes. After each round, agents update their strategies by imitating neighbors with higher payoffs.

The program produces: time-series cooperation trajectories, payoff trajectories, comparison plots across noise levels, aggregated summary data.

All results are fully reproducible through one automated MATLAB script.


### Input files

All input files are located in "data/".

There are no external user-provided inputs. All CSV files are generated automatically by the C simulation and used as inputs for MATLAB analysis.

### Output files

All output files are generated automaticallyin "results/".

Generated outputs include:
* CSV files containing cooperation time series and final strategy composition.
* PNG figures stored in "results/figures/", including:
  * cooperation over time,
  * final cooperation vs noise,
  * strategy composition vs noise.


### Report

The final report is located in `docs/report.pdf`.

The report is written as a standalone document and includes:
1. Deviations from project proposal
2. Introduction
3. Approach
4. Results
5. Conclusion and outlook
6. Authorship statement

## Running the program

### Dependencies

Describe the operating system, programs (MATLAB/Python/C), version numbers, and external packages that need to be installed to run the program. Canonically, it should run on the SIE Linux VDI, but if you require a different configuration (e.g., more updated MATLAB version) you can state it here.

### Build

Compile the C simulation from the project root:

```bash
gcc -O3 src/c/pd_simulation.c -o bin/pd_simulation -lm

The executable is placed in bin/. Executables are not distributed and must be built locally.

### Execute

Run the C simulation for each noise level:

./bin/pd_simulation 0.00 data/pnoise_0.00.csv
./bin/pd_simulation 0.05 data/pnoise_0.05.csv
./bin/pd_simulation 0.10 data/pnoise_0.10.csv

Then run MATLAB analysis:

run("src/matlab/analyze_results.m")

All figures are generated automatically
