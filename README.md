# The Fragility of Trust: Modeling Cooperation and Defection in a Noisy Networked Prisoner's Dilemma

## Project Description

This project develops a computational model to study the evolution of cooperation in a population of interacting agents when interactions are subject to stochstic noise. The system is modeled as a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma played on a fixed network, where agents follow simple behavioral strategies and may make mistakes in executing intended actions.

The goal of this project is to quantify how increasing levels of noise affect: 

* short-term cooperation dynamics,
* long-term cooperation levels,
* and the stability of cooperative behavior.

* ALLC - Always Cooperate
* ALLD - Always Defect
* TFT - Tit-for-Tat
* GRUD - Grudger

At each interaction, agents may unintentionally flip their intended action with probability p_noise, reflecting real-world mistakes. After each round, agents update their strategies by imitating neighbors with higher payoffs.

The program produces: time-series cooperation trajectories, payoff trajectories, comparison plots across noise levels, aggregated summary data.


### Input files

All input data files are located in the "data/" directory.

There are no external user-provided inputs. All CSV files are generated automatically by the C simulation and used as inputs for MATLAB analysis.

Each file contains : 
* time step index,
* fraction of cooperative actions at each time step,
* final strategy composition (appended at the end of the file)

### Output files

All output files are generated automaticallyin in the "results/" directory.

Three PNG figures are stored in the "results/figures/" directory:
  * coop_dynamics_multi_noise.png : cooperation over time for all noise levels on a single plot
  * final_coop_vs_nnoise.png : long-term cooperation as a function of noise probability
  * coop_heatmap_time_noise.png : heatmap showing cooperation dynamics across time and noise levels
These figures are the ones used directly in the final report. 

### Report

The final report is located in "docs/report.pdf".

The report follows the required structure:
1. Deviations from project proposal
2. Introduction
3. Approach
4. Results
5. Conclusion and outlook
6. Authorship statement

## Running the program

### Dependencies

The project was developed and testeed on macOS, but is designed to run on the SIE Ubuntu Linux VDI. 

### Build

From the project root directory: 

gcc -O3 src/c/pd_simulation.c -o bin/pd_simulation -lm

The executable is created in bin/ and is not distribued with the repository. 

### Execute

From the project root directory, run the C simulations:

./bin/pd_simulation 0.00 data/pnoise_0.00.csv
./bin/pd_simulation 0.05 data/pnoise_0.01.csv
./bin/pd_simulation 0.10 data/pnoise_0.02.csv
./bin/pd_simulation 0.10 data/pnoise_0.05.csv
./bin/pd_simulation 0.10 data/pnoise_0.10.csv

Then run MATLAB analysis:

matlab -batch "run("src/matlab/analyze_results.m")"

This command generates the figures used in the report.
